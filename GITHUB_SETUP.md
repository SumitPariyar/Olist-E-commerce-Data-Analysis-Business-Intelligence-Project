# GitHub Setup Guide

## 🚀 How to Push Your Olist Project to GitHub

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the repository details:**
   - **Repository name**: `olist-ecommerce-analysis` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Comprehensive analysis of Olist e-commerce data including customer churn prediction, SQL analysis, and business insights`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/olist-ecommerce-analysis.git

# Set the main branch as default
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Your Repository

1. **Go to your GitHub repository** in a web browser
2. **Verify that all files are uploaded**:
   - README.md should display properly
   - All directories should be visible
   - Large data files should be excluded (due to .gitignore)

### Step 4: Repository Features to Enable

1. **Go to Settings** in your repository
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional):
   - Go to Pages section
   - Select source branch (main)
   - Save to create a project website

3. **Add Topics** to make your repository discoverable:
   - Go to repository main page
   - Click on gear icon next to "About"
   - Add topics like: `data-science`, `machine-learning`, `ecommerce`, `python`, `sql`, `jupyter-notebook`

### Step 5: Update README.md (Optional)

You may want to update the README.md file with:
- Your actual GitHub username
- Your LinkedIn profile
- Any specific setup instructions for your environment

### Step 6: Share Your Repository

Your repository is now ready to share! You can:
- **Share the URL** with potential employers
- **Add it to your portfolio**
- **Include it in your resume**
- **Share it on LinkedIn**
